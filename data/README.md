# Data

`/data` contains raw, preprocessed, and enrichment PPI data for the target organism, *S. Cerevisiae*. A data overview may also be found in `overview`. This will be fed to the **prediction pipeline's** entry point at `/code`. Legacy data are obtained for fair comparison with previous papers.

Currently contains the following S. Cerevisiae datasets (large files are gitignored):

* BIOGRID 3.0.67 (2010)
* BIOGRID 4.4.227 (2023)
* CYC2008 (2008)
* DIP (2007)
* GO S. Cerevisiae (2023)
* iRefIndex (2023)
* SGD GSE3431 (2010)

If you need the gitignored files, you may find it in our teams.
