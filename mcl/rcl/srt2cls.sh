# We keep the Seurat 1-based indexing and we want Seurat and mcl indexing to
# refer to the same nodes (so we can easily computed distances etc).  To this
# end we introduce a dummy node with index 0 for mcl; this should already be
# present in the tab file (index-label mapping) given to this script. The first
# line should be '0\tdummy' (the script checks this).
#
# Subsequently we need to add a cluster with this dummy node to the seurat
# clustering when we encode it in an mcl matrix file.

# We do not in all cases maintain cluster label correspondence; one of the
# seurat algorithms labels the clusters starting at 1, this will be shifted to 0.
