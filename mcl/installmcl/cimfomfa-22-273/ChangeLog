   *  cimfomfa-21-341 released

	*  Fixed bug in let.c; it would think that 'abs(2) == abs(1)' is true.  The
		cause was a combination of two things: failure to maintain float/integer
		correspondence by abs and other functions, and a wrong ternary cascade that
		would check float (in)equality even if the integer (in)equality test was
		already conclusive.
