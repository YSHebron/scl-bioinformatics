# scl-bioinfo

[WIP] A bioinformatics project that aims to extend existing computational methods to predict (problematic) Protein Complexes from noisy PPINs and improve their performance. Output will be a prediction pipeline containing an improved algorithm.

Root folder will contain the entrypoint to our pipeline.
